# dspdevel_designs
Repository for the storage of casper_dspdevel module designs.
- Submodules realtimeradio fork of mlib_devel: https://github.com/realtimeradio/mlib_devel 
- Submodules casper_dspdevel: https://github.com/talonmyburgh/casper_dspdevel

Use local startsg (it is a symlink to startsg in mlib_devel).
Edit startsg.local.example -> startsg.local paths for MATLAB and VIVADO paths. It already knows where casper_dspdevel is.
